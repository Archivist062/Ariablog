		<p>AriaBlog is a small somewhat frameworky template to make websites really fast. With it, making a static website design comprised is a matter of 3 hours for any trained PHP (5 or 7) developer.</p>
		
		<p>It is meant to be simple, for this reason, it is fully based on a single SQLite database and a single entry point. To make a simple website, just add pages in the database using a simple SQLite graphical client, tweak the layouts to your liking and here you go !</p>
